//// TO DO


add arrows to snake pit

- maps
   snakes on a plain
   heads up
   platform over troubled waters
   surfs up
   surfs down
   apocalypse carrot
   hills are alive with the sound of ninja bunnies
   buffet of blocks
   executioner's castle
   puzzling blocks
   ninja jail
   it's raining creeps
   carrot catacylism
   mr cpu's castle
   snake pit
   ninja moutain
   boney one eye's castle
   eye in the sky
   executioner's revenge
   kangarang's castle
   cloud 9
   carrot armageddon
   running_ahead
   spring-a-thon
   king ghastly's castle

- to make
   working in a coal mine
   ninja HQ
   that sinking feeling
   blocks of confusion
   ???
   ???
   
   

   
   
Maps:
  - working in a coal mine (break blocks in mine - use left/right blocks)
  - Ninja HQ (tall girder skyscraper)
  - Bunnies Love Carrots (carrots on top, bunnies on bottom, trophy at start need to cross what's left of break blocks between carrots and bunnies)
  - That Sinking Feeling (tower with raising water)
  - blocks of confusion (maybe use left and right here)

- getTileData getSpriteData instead of one call, then don't need dups or variable sets
- editor: double click sprite for info, use info for other stuff

- background motion by tick
- ducking?  Need collision offset box changes
- clean up all unused imports
- both game and sprite still have some non-"on" events
- music needs a loop point, give music opening bars
- pendant tile for castle levels (next to bush tile)

- platforms need to push with API (and anything that stands on them)
- get rid of all map. or game.

- need transitions between worlds (closing squares)
- make game & map private in sprite and map private in game?

- smoke on quick turn around (by feet)
- smoke on jump land

- better water on world map?

- update snake art?
