//// TO DO


- move all constants to statics (next> playerworld)
- surf down waits at top and bottom


- go over every map




- clean up all unused imports



- move game time to 60 fps

- both game and sprite still have some non-"on" events

- music needs a loop point, give music opening bars

- editor: need x erase block
- editor: like to get rid of duplicate
- editor: scrolling down to fall erases sprites

- pendant tile for castle levels (next to bush tile)


Maps:
  - Ninja HQ (tall girder skyscraper)
  - Bunnies Love Carrots (carrots on top, bunnies on bottom, trophy at start need to cross what's left of break blocks between carrots and bunnies)
  - That Sinking Feeling (tower with raising water)



- particles by tick (just for the sprite call, convert them to timestamp after that)

- platforms need to push with API (and anything that stands on them)


- get rid of all map. or game.


- need transitions between worlds (closing squares)
- make game & map private in sprite and map private in game?

- trunc all drawimage coords


- smoke on quick turn around (by feet)
- smoke on jump land



- last boss can kill billy multiple times when grave

- better water on world map?

- snakes are the worst art, update them
- carrot needs shading
