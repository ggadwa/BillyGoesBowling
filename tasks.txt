* particles need view culling
* tick sound effect


1. no image types, use tiles\ to figure it out
2. use map in imagelist
3. get type by iterating the entities
4. rename entity to sprite again







-> combine entities and sprites???
// obj.constructor.name
-> entities pick sprites
-> sprite list is an entity list???

-> maps don't use game, just data
-> get rid of images in entity, use entity instead of sprites
-> new way for UI images

+ use new tile list
+ use new sprite list
+ separate image types into sub directories
