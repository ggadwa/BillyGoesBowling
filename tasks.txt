//// TO DO

- add a gravityJumpPauseTick - gravity pauses for X ticks
- have smaller jump value

- get rid of all timestamp stuff, use ticks
- runAI passes in game tick

- automatically decelerate in air?

- smoke on quick turn around (by feet)

- player movement acceleration based
- different deceleration on ground (fast) and slow (air)
- jump accelerates player a bit more
- three jump sprites (timed)
- have small air control, but don't change direction of sprite

- move motion and such to sprite????

- interaction has a command variable

* make bowling ball fire at any time but it always picks the middle of the closest Y block
* give billy a defensive move with ball (rotates clockwise around player)
* ball reforms instead of coming down
* spin move destroys ball at end
* shake shield randomly by 1 or 2 pixels
- spin makes player invincible for a bit draw shield

- can't move with shield on



* bunny weapons can be stopped by ball
* bombs can be stopped by ball
- ninja bunny hitting player kills ninja bunny

* easter head fires fish
* fish arc at beginning
* fish can be stopped by ball
* easter heads flash eyes when throwing fish

- need to use controllers
- destroyed carrots reset
- carrots fire bombs at random times
- make executioner always jump around
- last boss can kill billy multiple times when grave
- add bush, small hill, and walk cycle to world map
- better water on world map?

- do awaits on all the initialization loops in game.js
* reverse particles
- snakes are the worst art, update them
- readjust the bounce pads (need slower push)
- add keys/secret exits (one could be having to race explosives throughout level for key at end before it falls in water)
- pin has some stray alpha pixels
- carrot needs shading

- world view player's hair looks wrong

- do left/right by translate

- rotate particles
    context.translate(x, y);
    context.rotate(angleInRadians);
    context.drawImage(image, -width / 2, -height / 2, width, height);
    context.rotate(-angleInRadians);
    context.translate(-x, -y);
    (use context save/restore)


- editor: put buttons as small font awesome/font material on right side
- editor: add ?map=world_main
