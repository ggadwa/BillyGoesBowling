//// TO DO


- replace interactWithSprite with sendMessage(callSprite,cmd,data)
- other side overrides processMessage(fromSprite,cmd,data)

- need hurt for player collisions

- adjust collisions with billy and shield from other creatures
- spin makes player invincible for a bit draw shield
- can't move with shield on
- redo all scripts first
- put gravity in places it needs to be
- find (and remove) all timestamp in scripts (use tick)

- need transitions between worlds (closing squares)

- trunc all drawimage coords
- why does snake face wrong way when hurt?

- move game time to 60 fps


- get rid of all timestamp stuff, use ticks (MAYBE???) - particle by ticks
- smoke on quick turn around (by feet)
- smoke on jump land






- mr cpu needs jumping legs
- boney one eye faces you X wise (and fires eye from different location)
- boney one eye forms eye by alpha before firing (maybe doesn't have eye on sprite?)

- ninja bunny hitting player kills ninja bunny


- need to use controllers
- destroyed carrots reset
- carrots fire bombs at random times
- make executioner always jump around and always throw axes
- last boss can kill billy multiple times when grave
- add bush, small hill, and walk cycle to world map
- better water on world map?

- do awaits on all the initialization loops in game.js
* reverse particles
- snakes are the worst art, update them
- readjust the bounce pads (need slower push)
- add keys/secret exits (one could be having to race explosives throughout level for key at end before it falls in water)
- carrot needs shading



- editor: put buttons as small font awesome/font material on right side
- editor: add ?map=world_main
